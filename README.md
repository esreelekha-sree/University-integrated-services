University Integrated Services

 Project Overview
University Integrated Services is a web-based application designed to centralize and manage multiple university-related services on a single platform.  
The system aims to improve efficiency, accessibility, and transparency for students, faculty, and administrators.

This project is developed by combining Java-based web technologies with a Machine Learning module for intelligent processing.



 Objectives
- To provide a unified platform for university services  
- To simplify academic and administrative processes  
- To improve user experience through centralized access  
- To reduce manual work and data redundancy  
- To enhance decision-making using Machine Learning techniques  



 Technologies Used

🔹 Frontend
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- JSP  

🔹 Backend (Web Application)
- Java  
- Servlets  
- Apache Tomcat  
- Maven  

🔹 Machine Learning & API
- Python  
- FastAPI (ML microservice)
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)
- Cosine Similarity

🔹 Database
- MySQL  

🔹 Tools & Version Control
- Eclipse IDE  
- Git & GitHub  



 System Architecture
- Client–Server architecture  
- MVC (Model–View–Controller) design pattern  
- Java-based web application handles UI and business logic  
- Python-based FastAPI microservice handles Machine Learning processing  
- RESTful communication between Java application and ML service  



Machine Learning Component

The project integrates a Machine Learning module to provide intelligent similarity-based results and recommendations.

 🔹 ML Workflow
1. Textual data is collected and preprocessed  
2. Features are extracted using **TF-IDF Vectorization**  
3. Similarity between records is computed using **Cosine Similarity**  
4. The ML logic is exposed as REST APIs using **FastAPI**  
5. The Java web application consumes the ML API responses  

 🔹 Advantages
- Efficient handling of textual data  
- Improved accuracy in similarity matching  
- Scalable ML service using FastAPI  
- Separation of concerns using microservice architecture
